# ShellAndEnum

This app is to use SHELL32.DLL to get extra attribute like duration of a mp3 file etc.
also
This app is to give or demonstrate how to use ENUM data type.  I modified weatherforcast sample angular application to do it since this come from Msft.

I published this app so that other start up app developer like me can use them as a sample/guide to do it.  I have spend a lot time to figure this one out.
If you've gone thru this app, pleasea go back to Msft documentation to compare mine vs theirs.  Thanks Microsoft.


I am using VS2022 and Dotnet core 6 in this application.  I believe this will work Dotnet core 5 as well except that the code need to mod about nullable.:)
Good Luck.
